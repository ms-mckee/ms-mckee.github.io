I've been learning about Universal Design for Learning (UDL). According to the National Assocation for Universal Design's website at [http://www.udlcenter.org/](http://www.udlcenter.org/), UDL is, "a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn. UDL provides a blueprint for creating instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments that work for everyone--not a single, one-size-fits-all solution but rather flexible approaches that can be customized and adjusted for individual needs."

UDL recommends three primary guidelines for teaching diverse learners who's learning styles are as unique as their fingerprints. The first recommendation is to provide multiple means of representation. This idea is familiar to anyone with a teaching background, and is akin to Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Not all students will learn by just listening to information, some will need to see new information written down. UDL refers to this as "options for perception." I definitely try to do this with my class, I find speaking, writing and drawing new concepts helps support my students, both English proficient students and English Language Learners. Following the guidelines set forth by UDL helps improve comprhension student with special needs, such as English Language Learners, and other students who do not share these needs as well.
