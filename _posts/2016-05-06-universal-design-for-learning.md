I've been learning about Universal Design for Learning (UDL). According to the National Assocation for Universal Design's website at <a href="http://www.udlcenter.org/">www.udlcenter.org.</a> UDL is, "a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn. UDL provides a blueprint for creating instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments that work for everyone--not a single, one-size-fits-all solution but rather flexible approaches that can be customized and adjusted for individual needs."

The idea of Universal Design was first introduced in architecture. The idea is that when architects plan buildings and environments, if new structures are designed to meet the needs of disabled users, all users will benefit. The classic example is the curb cut. The curb cut allows for access for people in wheelchairs, but also for people using strollers and rolling luggage.

UDL recommends three primary guidelines for teaching diverse learners who's learning styles are as unique as their fingerprints. Students with learning diabilities or English learners are seen as part of a diverse students population, not a special population in need of accomodations. Planning inclusive instruction will ultimately benefit all students.

UDL's first recommendation is to provide multiple means of representation. This refers to the content, or "what" students will learn." Not all students will learn by just listening to information, some will need to see new information written down. UDL refers to this as "options for perception." I try to scaffold in this way with my Kindergarten class which include students with IEPs and English learners. I try to include verbal, auditory and kinesthetic activities to provide multiple means of representation. GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) strategies include concrete ways to provide multiple means of representation that help deepen comprehension for all learners.

The second recommendation is to provide multiple means of expression. Students must have the opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned in different ways. A student with a learning disability may be unable to write a paper in the same way other students are able. This student may benefit from verbalizing understanding and filming a verbal expression of their understanding.

UDL's third recommendation is to provide multiple means of engagement. As educators we know that motivating students to learn is crucial. Some students may be motivated by working in small groups with peers, others may find these interactions intimidating. Not all leaners are engaged in the same ways, which is why it's important to provide multiple means of engagement.

UDL is also known as Universal Instructional Design (UID). As educators work to teach, engage and assess students with diverse backgrounds and abilities Universal Design becomes increasingly important. Rather than planning accomodations for students with special needs, designing instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners from the onset creates an inclusive learning environment that benfits all students.
