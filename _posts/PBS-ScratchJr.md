Scratch Jr. is another great app available that is available for free on Android and iOS operating systems! Students learn the basics of computer programming while using their imaginations and developing critical thinking and problem solving skills. Students can choose characters and settings, and then program the characters to do different actions. Activities incorporated into the platform help to scaffold student's ability to program. I have used this app with students as young as Kindergarten and they love it! I need to find time to explore it more myself in order to find the best uses with my class.
