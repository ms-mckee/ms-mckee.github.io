<p>At our school site, we have had many problems connecting to the iTunes store to download educational apps. Here are the steps I've followed to get the devices to connect to the iTunes store.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always start by restarting the device.</li>
<li><ul>
  <li>Hold the button at upper right down until screen goes black</li>
  <li>Press button again to power on</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it still won't connect, go to Settings and check for updates</li>

<li> Choose Setting from the App Menu, then click on General</li>

<li> Click on Software updates</li>

<li> Available updates will display. Click to install updates.</li>

</li> After upadtes are installe,device will automatically restart and display "Welcome."</li>

</li>Device will prompt "Create a Passcode." Click "Passcode Options." Choose "Don't Add Passcode" for shared classroom devices. Click "Continue." If needed, finish setting up iCloud using Apple ID.</li> 

<li>Still not connecting after installing updates?</li>

</li> Open Settings from Application Menu again. </li>

</li> Make sure the Wifi in turned on- the toggle should be green. </li>

</li> Choose a Network</li>

</li> Try connecting to a different network if more than one is available. At our site the devices will sometimes appear to be connecting, but still will not connect to iTunes store. Accessing the store through a different Wifi connection has been successful.</li>
<li>If you are still not able to connect to teh iTunes store, the last option is to try a "Hard Reset."</li>

</li> To reset the device hold down power button and home screen button simultaneously for 10-15 second. Device will restart.</li>

</li> Go into Settings.</li>

</li> Choose Reset. </li>

</li> Choose Reset all settings.</li>

</li>Reconnect to wifi.</li>
<p>Hope this helps, and you're able to connect to the iTunes store. If the device is still not connecting, call Apple customer service. You may be on hold for a while, but I've been able to get the devices to connect after talking to the customer service representatives.</p>
