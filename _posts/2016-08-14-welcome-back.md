To all my fellow public school teachers- welcome back! I'm so excited because this year I will be working as a Library Media Teacher. The library is changing so much in the public school setting. The focus has become much more on teaching students research skills and addressing digital citizenship. As a book lover, I want to strike a balance between technology and literacy with my students this year. Best of luck to the teachers, students and support staff, and hope everyone has an awesome year!
