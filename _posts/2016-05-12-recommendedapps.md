It's been so fun getting the iPads working and into the hands of the Kindergartners! Below are a few (free*) apps I would recommend for Kinder. Enjoy!

<h>Native Numbers</h>
This free app helps young children develop number sense. Developing strong number sense in the early grades gives children the foundation needed to be succesful in upper grades. This shows multiple representations of numbers, including numerals, number rods, objects, words, tally marks, etc. so that children deepen their number sense. The activities are fast paced, and engage the most gifted math students. An initally free subscription allows the teacher to track student progress from one convenient home screen. 
I highly recommend this app for young children!
