<p>Thanks for visiting my webpage! I am a Bay Area public school teacher with over five years experience. I taught Spanish bilingual first grade for four years, and currently teach Kindergarten in an English only classroom. On top of all that, I'm earning a Master's Degree in Education (Instructional Technoloiges) from San Francisco State University. To hear more about what I've been working on, read my blog!
