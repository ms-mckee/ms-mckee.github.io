<p>Thanks for visiting my webpage! I am a Bay Area public school teacher with over five years experience. I've taught Spanish bilingual first grade for four year, and currently work in an English only classroom teaching Kindergarten. On top of all that, I'm earning a Master's Degree in Education (Instructional Technoloiges) from San Francisco State University. To hear more about what I've been working on, read my blog!
